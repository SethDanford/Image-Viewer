# Image Viewer
 ## What does it do?
 It displays images, simple!
 ## How does it work?
 When the app is first run, you will be given a list of image file names, if you tap on one of the file names
 that file will open to display the image associated with that file.
 If you want to go back then you simply tap on the "back" button in the top left of the navigation bar.
 If you tap on the photo while the photo is displaying, the navigation bar will go away, tap again and it will return.
